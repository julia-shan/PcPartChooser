# project-2-team_69

This document is intended to explain this project undertaken as well as the prerequisites and future implementations that were currently out of our scope.

## Project purpose:
The purpose of this project was to create an app that showcased PC parts from 5 categories - CPU, GPU, Memory (RAM), Motherboard, and Storage. Each category contains 10 items, and each item contained specific details about itself, such as the clock speed, connection type, size and other applicable fields.

This data is stored in a csv and loaded into a DataProvider singleton class, in place of a database.


## Prerequisites: 

The app currently has a minimum sdk of Android 8 (API level 26). This was to allow for most android devices while also benefitting from newer methods mainly regarding the UI and data types.

## Future Updates: 
Our intentions for future updates would be things to improve the user experience predominantly. These include: 

> Improving our search algorithm to be more flexible

> Be more flexible with our data input

> Populate the SearchActivity as the user types

For a more comprehensive list, look at the Future Features in our Github Issues page.
